title: Improv techniques and jQuery
summary: "Ask if the thing you're looking at is just one instance of something deeper."

I’ve spent about half of my life playing on improv teams of various sorts. The Comedy Sportz Milwaukee High School League gave me my first exposure to “short-form” (Whose Line is it Anyway style) improv and in college and beyond I fell into the “long-form” style developed in Chicago and seen in theaters like iO and Upright Citizens Brigade. Agreement, confidence in the midst of uncertainty, teamwork and many other skills get cultivated in the improv community. I often find myself apply lessons learned on stage or in the rehearsal room and bringing them to my work life as a web developer.  Occasionally, ideas and concepts flow the other way.

### A brief diversion on jQuery effects.


The jQuery effects like fadeOut() and slideDown() blew me away when I encountered them in the mid-2000s. They’re incredibly easy to understand and use once a developer gets the idea of how to implement them

You can use them before you really understand animate. Just as you can use the swinging door and split scene before really understanding the “this-vs-this” principles in play.

Once you understand the basic two person split scene, why not a split scene with a more people on each side? Take the Summer Nights

Aside from being a reminder of how choreography and a catchy tune can mask some nauseating gender role caricatures and allusions to date-rape, this scene shows how the "this-versus-this" dynamic does not depend on the number of people on each side.
