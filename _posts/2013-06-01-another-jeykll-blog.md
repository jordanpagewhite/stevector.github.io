title: Another Jekyll blog

@todo Insert "version control all of the things" image in here.

I'm jumping on the bandwagon. My vague ambitions to start a blog have combined with my desire to built something outside of [Drupal](https://drupal.org) (the technology that has been at the center of my job for six years). So here's stevector.com made wtih [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

From [the Jekyll docs page](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/):

> Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through Markdown (or Textile) and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server.

That's a lot of jargon that boils to two principles that appeal to me.

### 1. Only think about something when you have to think about.
For a webpage like this to get to a browser it is necessary for a computer to stitch together these words along with some template code and stylesheets. Jekyll does that work as I write and save a post. Drupal and most other modern site-building tools will do that work over and over again as more people as for the webpage. The "over and over again" approach allows a site to be slightly different for each logged in user or to constantly update something like the "most popular stories" list. Losing the ability to "think" everytime a page is requested feels like I've thrown out the majority of my toolbox as a web developer. And that's ok. For a site this simple it's not necessary to carry around those heavy tools.

### 2. Version controlling content





- "Static site generator" means that the computer holding the Jekyll site can serve a plain old .html file. Drupal, Wordpress,

is not thinking when a browser asks for a page.

In the years I've built sites with Drupal it has asked servers to use more and more computational power to server single pages. And with good reason too. Drupal sites 

that the page a Jekyll site delivers to a browser was created long before the browser asked for it. That's 







Jekyll caught my attention when I saw it used by a few Drupal developers for their own blogs like those of [Jeff Eaton](http://angrylittletree.com/), and [Matt Farina](http://engineeredweb.com/blog/why-switched-to-jekyll/). Nearly every site I've ever built has relied on a database


I then used it ([the "Hekyll" version](https://github.com/bmcmurray/hekyll)) to create a presentation called Workbench for Wookies. Then eye-catching government project like [ehawaii.gov](http://portal.ehawaii.gov/page/developers/) and [healthcare.gov](http://developmentseed.org/blog/new-healthcare-gov-is-open-and-cms-free/) made it clear that I need to jump on the band wagon.
