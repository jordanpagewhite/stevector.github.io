title: Another Jekyll blog 
---

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) caught my attention when I saw it used by Drupal developers for their own blogs like those of [Jeff Eaton](http://angrylittletree.com/), and [Matt Farina](http://engineeredweb.com/blog/why-switched-to-jekyll/). I then used it ([the "Hekyll" version](https://github.com/bmcmurray/hekyll)) to create a presentation called Workbench for Wookies. Then eye-catching government project like [ehawaii.gov](http://portal.ehawaii.gov/page/developers/) and [healthcare.gov](http://developmentseed.org/blog/new-healthcare-gov-is-open-and-cms-free/) made it clear that I need to jump on the band wagon.
