title: My skyrocketing exclamation point usage!
---


### What's the deal?

I parsed over four years of my Google Voice data to look for exclamation points. This graph shows what I found.


### Why did I do that?


My girlfriend and I had talked about how nearly all of our messages contain exclamation points.
I had chatted with friends about exclamation points’ omnipresence.
And then [Ben Crair](https://twitter.com/bencrair) wrote [a story in The New Republic](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/115726/period-our-simplest-punctuation-mark-has-become-sign-anger) that brought some more high profile ancedata about exclamation points as “sincerity markers.”

After all that converation I figured that this question was entirely answerable.
So I downloaded my full Google Voice history and parsed it.


### Who was I texting?

Mostly my girlfriend. We've been together since late October of 2012. I suspect her frequent exclamation usage has influenced me.


### How did I do that?

First, I [exported my Google Voice history with Google Takeout](http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/06/google-now-lets-you-export-google-voice-data/).
Then I wrote a couple of PHP classes to parse the files in arrays that could be manipulated more easily.
Those classes then went into a [Symfony](http://symfony.com/) bundle that used [Altamira](https://github.com/Malwarebytes/Altamira) to display the data through [jqPlot](http://www.jqplot.com/).
This code was the first time I wrote a Symfony bundle or app.
I've got [an open Pull Request against my blog](https://github.com/stevector/stevector.github.io/pull/9) with an in-progress post that has more details on how the code works.

### Where can the work be checked?


------


In september of 2009 only X% of my texts sent through Google Voice contained exclamation points. In November 2013 it was Y%








Since DATE I have sent X text messages through Google Voice. 


Ancedata abounds for the shifting usage of the exclamation point.




How did I do it.


What’s the deal?

I am now X times more likely to use an exclamation point in a text than I was in 2009. Here’s a month-by-month graph of the percentage of my texts that contained at least on exclamation point.

When did the shift occur



Why does that matter?

The meaning of punctuation is shifting.

Who was I texting?




How did this analysis happen?



Where can the work be checked?

Well I don’t want the NSA reading my texts and I don’t want you reading them either. So to a certain extend you’ll just have to trust me.
